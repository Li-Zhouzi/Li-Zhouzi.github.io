I am Zhouzi Li (李洲子 in Chinese, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-PQMSZ0yWY1qNoNEiM1hRIxcN_zmG3My/view?usp=share_link">How to pronounce</a>), and I also go by Arthur. I am currently a senior major in computer science at Yao Class, Tsinghua University. I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, especially algorithm design and learning theory.


My research interests lie in **theoretical machine learning** and **non-convex optimization.** I am searching for a Ph.D. position in 2023 Fall. I am eager to explore the mystery of deep learning in aspects of optimization and generalization, and actively search for theoretical explanations to it.

### Education

- An undergraduate in **"Yao class"**, a special CS pilot class established by Turing Award Laureate, **Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao.**
- Visiting student in 2022 Spring, CS department, Duke University.
