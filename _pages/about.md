Hi! I am Zixuan Wang.  I am an undergraduate in Institutes for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University.



My research interests lie in **theoretical machine learning** and **non-convex optimization.** I am searching for a Ph.D. position in 2023 Fall. I am eager to explore the mystery of deep learning in aspects of optimization and generalization, and actively search for theoretical explanations to it.

### Education

- An undergraduate in **"Yao class"**, a special CS pilot class established by Turing Award Laureate, **Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao.**
- Visiting student in 2022 Spring, CS department, Duke University.
